# Basil365
I want fresh basil all year round, but outdoors here it doesn't grow. Let's fix this, and make it IoT.

## Initial research
Buying a growlamp on the internet would be quite easy and cheap, but wouldn't make for a great DIY IoT project, so who cares, i'm going to roll my own IoT growlamp. And i want it to be the best and most efficient growlamp ever made. Since we are there, why not adding a load of sensors and connect it to a telegram bot to harass you? Seems great, let's do it.  

Starting from the lamp, we want it led based. If you've ever seen a led growlamp before, you know that they are made of blue and red LEDs. But maybe we can do better.
